/*
	This grading program will have the following policies:
	• Two quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points, are given.
	• One midterm exam and one final exam, each graded on the basis 
	  of 100 points, are given.
	• The final exam counts for 50 percent of the grade, the midterm 
	  counts for 25 percent, and the two quizzes together count for a 
	  total of 25 percent.
